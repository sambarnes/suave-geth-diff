          * Adds `BuildBlockFromTxs`and `BuildBlockFromBundles` to the `ethapi.Backend`
          interface.
          
          * Hooks in SUAVE execution backends (`ConfidentialStoreBackend`,
          `MempoolBackend`, and `OffchainEthBackend`) to the full-node's interface.

          * Support for `OffchainTxType` and `OffchainExecutedTxType`

          * New fields on `TransactionArgs` to support offchain tx types

            description: |
              A convenient wrapper for calling the SUAVE precompiles from Solidity. The
              library makes the precompiles easier to call by providing the signatures,
              and the library functions themselves simply perform a staticcall of the
              requested precompile.

              This repository contains the Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting
              with a Suave Geth node for live testing and demo'ing purposes. The Suave
              CLI allows users to deploy contracts, send bids, and perform various
              actions related to MEV-Share and Block Building.
